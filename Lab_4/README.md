# MULTI-LEVEL PARKING SIMULATION (PART 3)

In this laboratory work I implemented and emphasized 5 scenarios of my simulation.

Here is the list of them with a short description:
  1. `Simple car with mass < 1500` comes to the parking;
    The car can be lifted to the second level and parked, then leaves.
  2. `Simple car with mass >= 1500` comes to the parking;
    The car cannot be lifted to another level and has to leave the parking.
  3. `Electric car with a charged battery` comes to the parking;
    The car is parked and charged, then leaves.
  4. `Electric car with a low battery' comes to the parking;
    The car is parked, charged and then service manager supplies the chargers.
  5. `Disability car` comes to the parking;
    The car for people with disabilities is being parked, then leaves.
