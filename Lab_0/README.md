First of all, I have chosen the Ubuntu distribution of the Linux to
install on my computer using dual-boot (Windows OS was saved). I decide to make the auto partition of the disk space and just dedicated 95 Gbs of space for Ubuntu.

Secondly, I installed zsh shell and added a theme to it using oh-my-zsh (essembleh theme). I also installed Git, Atom code and text editor. The gcc compiler was already installed in Ubuntu so I did not have to type "$sudo apt install build-essentials" in the terminal.

Finally, I created a public repo on Github, cloned into a local repo on my computer. Then I wrote and compiled a simple C program together with a Makefile for it. I commited these files using git add, commit and push commands. However, the screenshots of all these manipulations were added manually, copying them from my phone (I took photos on it), to the earlier created directory and then commiting it too.
