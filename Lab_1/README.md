The file 15_game.c contains the implementation of the game which is very often
called "piatnashki". It contains all the requirements from the laboratory description.

The code does not contain the data structures because there is no need in creating
them in this case. The game board where the actions are being performed represents
a 4x4 matrix with numbers 0..15, where 0 represents the empty space. The player
has to move that space in order to put the numbers in an ascending order having 0
at the beginning or at the end of them.

There are the possibilities to pause the game, restart it or undo the last move.

Colorful interface is also supported.
